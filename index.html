                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

                <p class=" my-4">The increasing generation of waste has surpassed our capacity to manage it
                    effectively,
                    leading to
                    the emergence of trash mountains, overflowing landfills, increased pollution, and numerous
                    associated problems. The lack of proper waste disposal systems, inadequate waste recycling
                    infrastructure, and inefficiencies in waste management has created a big global environment
                    crisis
                    which if not tackeled immediately would prove to be an even bigger problem than it already is.
