                    <p class="ms-2">There is no clear incetive/reason for a citizen to properly dispose of the waste,
                        humans generally prefers to do the easy things and so proper waste segregation is much harder,
                        time consuming and not rewarding. The only people who do segregate waste are mostly who have
                        understood its importance and the extent to which waste pollution has affected us, and ofcourse
                        this number is very very very low. </p>

                <div>
                    <p class="ms-2">Instead of keeping the task unrewarding, my solution rewards people for properly
                        dispoing the waste. The then useless task is now usefull and worth the time and energy that will
                        be spent doing it as the person will be rewarded with EcoCoins(a virtual bin specific currency).
                        These EcoCoin could then be exchanged in for rewards. All of the sudden this dauting task has
                        become something people would look forward to.</p>

                            <p>1. The bins would be available for sale and could also be insatlled in public places

                            <p>2. The smart bins will have screens on them which will show information such as: their
                                EcoCoin balance, amount of waste disposed, possible rewards, a leaderboards (a need for
                                higher rank always encourages people to work more) etc.</p>
                            <p>3. When people put their waste, weight sensors will detect it and automatically reward
                                EcoCoins, to prevent exploiting the system more checks can be added and if needed,
                                manual check by the workers could also be used </p>
                            <p>4. When a person has the sufficient EcoCoins, the person can redeem them for rewards</p>
                            <p>5. People can alos be taught about waste segregation, its importance and related topics
                                form the screen</p>
                            <p>6. Screen could also act as an advertising screen for more revenue (i dont wish to use
                                this, but the option is there)</p>
